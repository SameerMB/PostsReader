# PostsReader
## Problem statement-
Using the API endpoint  
GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts  
GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users  
GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments  

Save the results of the request using a local database so that the app can still be used (after first successful connection) offline.
 
Create a simple Android app with two screens:
 
Screen1:   
a title  
a list view. Tapping a cell should take you to Screen2; each cell displaying:
  - post title
 
Screen2:  
back button should take you back to screen 1  
title  
labels for the fields:  
  - post title
  - post body
  - user name
  - number of comments

Use of 3rd party libraries (and dependency management) is accepted and encouraged.

Bonus:
Based on the userâ€™s email address, use http://avatars.adorable.io to generate a unique avatar for each of the contacts. To be shown on both screens. 
Tapping on user name should take you to a third screen with all user information including a map of their location based on lat and long values.
